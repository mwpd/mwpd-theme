 * This is what this interface represents, by assembling the separate,
 * segregated interfaces for each of these lifecycle actions.

 * Additionally, we provide a means to get access to the plugin's container that
 * collects all the services it is made up of. This allows direct access to the
 * services to outside code if needed.
